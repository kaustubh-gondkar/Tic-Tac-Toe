# Tic-Tac-Toe
A Tic Tac Toe game is a simple and classic game that can be played by two players. The game consists of a 3x3 grid where players take turns marking a square with their X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
